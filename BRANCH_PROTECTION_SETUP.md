# üõ°Ô∏è Branch Protection Setup Instructions

## Setting Up Status Checks for Branch Protection

### Step 1: Go to Branch Protection Settings
1. Navigate to your GitHub repository
2. Go to `Settings` > `Branches`
3. Click `Add rule` or edit existing rule for `main` branch

### Step 2: Configure Required Status Checks
In the branch protection rule, enable these options:

‚úÖ **Require a pull request before merging**
- Require approvals: 1
- Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed

‚úÖ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
- Require branches to be up to date before merging

**Add these EXACT status check names:**
```
Backend Tests
Frontend Tests
```

### Step 3: Additional Protection Rules (Recommended)
‚úÖ **Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB**
‚úÖ **Require linear history** (optional, keeps git history clean)
‚úÖ **Include administrators** (applies rules to admins too)

### Step 4: Verify Setup
After setting up, the branch protection should look like this:

```
Branch protection rule for main:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Require a pull request before merging
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Require approvals: 1
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Require status checks to pass before merging
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Require branches to be up to date before merging
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Backend Tests ‚úÖ
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Frontend Tests ‚úÖ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Include administrators
```

## Testing the Setup

### 1. Create a Test PR
```bash
git checkout -b test-branch-protection
echo "# Test change" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: verify branch protection"
git push origin test-branch-protection
```

### 2. Create Pull Request
- Go to GitHub and create a PR from `test-branch-protection` to `main`
- You should see status checks running
- The merge button should be disabled until checks pass

### 3. Verify Status Checks
The PR should show:
- ‚è≥ Backend Tests (running/pending)
- ‚è≥ Frontend Tests (running/pending)
- ‚úÖ Backend Tests (after completion)
- ‚úÖ Frontend Tests (after completion)

## Troubleshooting

### Status Checks Not Appearing?
1. **Check workflow names**: Must match exactly "Backend Tests" and "Frontend Tests"
2. **Trigger a workflow**: Push a commit to see if workflows run
3. **Check workflow files**: Ensure `.github/workflows/ci.yml` has correct job names

### Still Can't Find Status Checks?
1. Go to your repo's Actions tab
2. Run a workflow manually
3. After it completes, go back to branch protection settings
4. The status check names should now appear in the dropdown

### Common Issues:
- **Case sensitivity**: "Backend Tests" ‚â† "backend tests"
- **Spaces matter**: "Backend Tests" ‚â† "BackendTests"
- **Workflow must run first**: Status checks only appear after running at least once

## Alternative: Use Job IDs Instead of Names
If you prefer to use job IDs, update the branch protection to require:
```
test-backend
test-frontend
```

And remove the `name:` fields from the workflow jobs.

‚úÖ **After following these steps, your branch protection will prevent merging until all tests pass!**
