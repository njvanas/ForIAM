# 🔐 ForIAM (Forever Identity and Access Management)

A modern, modular, scalable Identity and Access Management (IAM) system — designed to be clean, extensible, and future-proof.

Inspired by OpenIAM and Okta, but with our own minimalistic, developer-focused twist.

---

## 📌 Overview

This platform provides:
- ✅ Secure user authentication (JWT, sessions, OAuth2)
- ✅ Role-based access control (RBAC + groups)
- ✅ Multitenant architecture from the ground up
- ✅ Full audit logging & session tracking
- ✅ REST API + Admin UI (React-based)
- ✅ Lightweight, containerized, cloud-ready design

> For a full feature breakdown, see [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
